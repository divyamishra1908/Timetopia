# Timetopia
A timetable generator PHP MySQL project is a web-based application that generates a schedule of classes for a school or university based on the available courses, teachers, and classrooms. The application helps to reduce the time and effort required to manually create a timetable and minimize scheduling conflicts between classes, teachers, and classrooms.
